# Telecom Churn Analysis

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in a telecom company, identify patterns, and provide insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset contains telecom customer information, including:
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Usage patterns
- Churn status

## Steps Taken
1.  Data Collection & Loading* – Import dataset and check basic info.
2.  Data Cleaning* – Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Analyze trends and visualize key features.
4.  Feature Selection* – Identify important features affecting churn.
5.  Modeling (Optional)* – Build predictive models to forecast churn (if required).
6.  Visualization* – Create charts and graphs for insights.

## Key Visualizations
- Churn distribution among customers
- Correlation heatmap of features
- Monthly charges vs. churn rate
- Tenure vs. churn rate
- Service-wise churn comparison

## Key Insights
- Customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more.
- Shorter-tenured customers are more likely to leave.
- Certain services (like streaming or tech support) impact churn rate significantly.
- Contract type (monthly vs. yearly) influences customer retention.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights critical factors affecting customer churn. Telecom companies can focus on pricing strategies, customer engagement, and service improvements to reduce churn and retain customers
